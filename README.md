# Python CLI Hangman Game

I was bored so I made a simple hangman game in Python.

## To run

1. Clone the folder to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/michaelyousrie/python-hangman-cli.git`
2. Run the game using `python main.py`
3. Try to save the man

## To extend

You can easily extend the words by adding them to the `words.json` file as this is the file that contains all the words that the game loads.
